This is the first file for my project. My intent is to parse data
from Louisville.gov open data CSV file, filter it for particular incidents,
and either perform (or at least create the searches for) a Google search
that would retrieve a news article on that fire incident.

My rationale for searching for more than one fire injury is that it will
give a greater likelihood for reporting of the incident. This also gives me
the chance to practice filtering data using Python. The precise nature of
the language reminds me of the efficiency of a specific Google search.

The goal for me is to build all of this up, and eventually, look for
patterns and draw conclusions from the results of my search. Perhaps I can
vizualize this data in a future project.
